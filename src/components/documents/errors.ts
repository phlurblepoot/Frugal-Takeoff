// Shared sentinel so a mid-send cancel can be told apart from a real send
// failure. Lives in its own module because both DocumentActionsBar (which
// throws it when the user backs out of the version/overwrite prompt, or when
// the pre-send save fails and has already been reported) and MailComposer
// (which must not toast an error for it) need it.
