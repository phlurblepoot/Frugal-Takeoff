// src/pages/project/rfi/PendingReplyBanner.tsx
//
// "Someone emailed an answer back on this RFI." The reply is captured
// server-side against the sent RFI but is deliberately NOT the recorded
// response until a person says so — an inbound email is a stranger's text, and
// the RFI response ends up on a printed, emailed document.
//
// Three rules the rest of this file exists to honour:
//
//  1. Everything the banner shows — the body, the sender's display name, every
//     attachment name — is attacker-chosen. It is rendered as React children
//     (escaped text) and nothing else: no dangerouslySetInnerHTML, no feeding
//     it into a PDF/HTML template, no building a path out of an attachment
//     name (the server sanitises names when it saves them to Documents).
//
//  2. pendingReply.accountId is the RECEIVING user's mailbox. Whoever sent the
//     RFI is usually not the person reading this banner, and for anyone else
//     the mail routes answer 403/404 — so the deep link is gated on
//     `canOpenThread`, which the editor works out, and the degraded state says
//     why rather than going silent.
//
//  3. Recording the answer is ALWAYS the accept endpoint, never a bare
//     setRfiResponse: accept records text and/or file AND clears the pending
//     row in one transaction. setRfiResponse would flip the RFI to answered
//     while leaving the reply pending — an orphan the banner would then hide.
//     The only exception is the fallback below, where the reply is already
//     gone and there is nothing left to clear.
