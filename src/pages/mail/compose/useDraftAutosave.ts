// src/pages/mail/compose/useDraftAutosave.ts — keeps a composer draft on the
// server so a closed tab doesn't lose a half-written message.
//
// Design notes:
//  - The snapshot the hook is *mounted* with is never saved. Opening a reply
//    seeds recipients, a subject and a quote; treating that as a change would
//    litter the Drafts folder with a draft per opened reply.
//  - Saves are debounced and collapse: a burst of typing produces one write,
//    always of the latest state.
//  - The first successful save records a draft id and every later save updates
//    it in place, so the folder holds one row per composer, not one per pause.
