// src/pages/documents/documentsPolicy.ts
// Pure selection-policy helper for the Documents page's bulk bar and per-row
// actions. Client-side mirror of the server guards in server/documents.ts
// (patchDocument/deleteDocument, spec §Safe deletion tiers) — every action
// still re-validates server-side, this only decides what the UI *offers*.
//
// `deletable` needs "no sourceType" (spec: "!sourceType && direct-upload
// kind"), but the /api/documents response (DocumentRow) never exposes the
// raw sourceType/sourceId — only the resolved `source` object built from
// them. `row.source` is non-null exactly when sourceType+sourceId were both
// set AND resolveSources() recognizes the sourceType (see server/documents.ts
// SIMPLE_RESOLVERS + resolvePrintouts/resolvePunch), which today covers every
// value in the canonical sourceType vocabulary — so `!row.source` is a safe
// proxy for `!sourceType`. A future sourceType added without a matching
// resolver would (harmlessly) make its rows look deletable here; the DELETE
// call would still 409 server-side since deleteDocument checks the raw
// sourceType column directly.
