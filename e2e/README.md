# End-to-end tests (Playwright)

These are browser-driven, full-stack characterization tests. They build the real
app, boot the real server against a throwaway SQLite database, and drive the SPA
in a real Chromium browser. They are **separate from `npm test`** (the Vitest
unit suite) and do not run as part of it.

## Running

```bash
npm run test:e2e          # headless, full e2e suite
npm run test:e2e:ui       # Playwright UI mode (pick/replay tests interactively)
npm run test:e2e e2e/export.spec.ts   # a single spec
```

Both scripts `rm -rf .e2e-data` first, so every run starts from a clean DB.

## How it works

- **App build + server boot.** Playwright's `webServer` runs
  `npm run build && STORAGE_PATH=.e2e-data PORT=3000 npx tsx server.ts`
  (see `playwright.config.ts`). It compiles the production client and serves it
  plus the API from `tsx server.ts` on **http://localhost:3000**.
- **Throwaway database.** `STORAGE_PATH=.e2e-data` points the server at a
  disposable `.e2e-data` SQLite DB. The npm scripts wipe `.e2e-data` before each
  run, so tests never see data from a previous run (or from your dev DB). Boot
  also runs migrations against this fresh DB.
- **Auth.** Tests log in as the bootstrap `admin` / `admin` user via
  `POST /api/auth/login` (`fixtures/seed.ts`). The `authedPage` fixture seeds
  `localStorage.token` + `localStorage.user` via an init script that runs
  **before** first paint, so the SPA loads authed routes without bouncing to
  `/login`.
- **Seeding via the API.** Specs seed fresh projects (random ids per test, to
  avoid cross-test bleed on the shared server/DB) through the REST API rather
  than the UI: `seedProjectWithPage` (a project + one raster page) and
  `seedProjectWithTakeoffMeasurement` (adds one takeoff + one length measurement
  wired to it — the minimum shape the Print/highlights path needs).
- **Self-referential canvas coordinates.** The canvas spec does not hard-code
  device pixels. It **calibrates** the page→screen mapping from the rendered
  canvas itself (read the on-screen geometry, set the scale by clicking known
  points), then **measures** in that same self-derived coordinate space. This
  keeps the canvas assertions stable across viewport/DPR differences instead of
  depending on magic pixel offsets.
- **Serial, single worker.** `fullyParallel: false`, `workers: 1` — the suite
  shares one server/DB, so tests run one at a time.
- **Mail runs on a fake provider.** `playwright.config.ts`'s `webServer` sets
  `MAIL_FAKE_PROVIDER=1` (and `APP_PUBLIC_URL`). That flag does two things in
  `server/mail/`: every mail account is routed through the in-memory
  `FakeMailProvider` instead of a real IMAP/OAuth mailbox, and the test-only
  `POST /api/mail/_test/seed` + `/inject` routes are mounted. `e2e/fixtures/mail.ts`
  wraps those three moving parts:
  - `resetMailAccounts(request, token)` — delete every mailbox this user owns
    (cascading its folders/threads/messages). **Call it first in every mail
    test**: the DB is shared across spec files, so a leftover mailbox would
    decide where `/mail` redirects and would be counted by the sidebar's
    unread badge.
  - `connectFakeAccount(request, token, { emailAddress, threads })` — create
    the account and seed it with proper References/In-Reply-To chains; returns
    `{ accountId, threadKeys }`.
  - `injectReply(request, token, { accountId, threadKey, from, text })` — an
    inbound message on an existing thread. Fire-and-forget server-side (it
    nudges the sync worker), so assert through the UI, not on the promise.

  `FakeMailProvider.seed()` clears that account's whole in-memory map, so it is
  **one fake account per test** — never re-seed an account a test already used.

## One-time system requirement (Chromium)

Chromium needs a few system libraries (`libnspr4`, `libnss3`, `libasound2t64`).
Install them once with:

```bash
npx playwright install-deps chromium
# (and, if the browser binary itself is missing)
npx playwright install chromium
```

## What's covered

- **Smoke** — app boots, authed routes load.
- **Auth** — login / redirect behavior.
- **Pages tab** — page list / page section behavior.
- **Takeoffs tab** — create / edit / delete a takeoff, advanced-cost toggle
  persistence.
- **Canvas** — calibrate scale, then draw a measurement (self-referential
  coordinates).
- **Exports** — Takeoffs-tab Print and Excel. Both buttons only render once a
  takeoff is selected; both persist a **printout** server-side and navigate to
  the Proposal section (they do **not** trigger a browser download — that lives
  on the Proposal section's per-printout Download button). The specs assert the
  resulting Excel/PDF printout appears in the Proposal "Printout history"; they
  do **not** assert on workbook/PDF binary content.
- **Mail — inbox** (`mail.spec.ts`) — seeded threads and the sidebar unread
  badge, opening a thread (subject, sandboxed body iframe, the "Remote images
  blocked" bar and Load images), Save-to-Documents on an attachment, the inline
  reply composer, archiving, composing a new message with recipient
  autocomplete, and the phone-width stacked layout.
- **Mail — item send** (`mail-item-send.spec.ts`) — the RFI editor's document
  bar → Email → the shared composer (prefilled recipient + primary attachment)
  → send: the RFI is stamped Sent, a thread link is created, the SentThreadChip
  deep-links into the conversation, a second send is offered "Reply in existing
  thread" (and still yields one link row), and Send is blocked with a reason
  once the last mail account is removed.
- **Mail — RFI email reply** (`mail-rfi-reply.spec.ts`) — an injected inbound
  reply is captured as a *pending* reply (never an automatic answer): the RFI
  row gets a Reply chip, the editor's banner shows the quote-stripped text, and
  Use-as-response records it (`status: answered`, `responseSource: 'email'`)
  while Dismiss drops it and leaves the RFI Sent.

## What's intentionally NOT covered

Favorites, page/takeoff context menus, multi-select, revisions / compare,
collaboration cursors, the full add-pages upload flow, and retry-failed.
